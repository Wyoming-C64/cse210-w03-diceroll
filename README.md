## Dice
---
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Dice and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Roll 
the dice. Count the ones and fives. Each one is worth 100 and 50 points respectively. As long as you 
roll at least a one or a five you can try again. If not the game is over.

## Rules
---
The game is played according to the following rules:
- The game is played with five dice.
- The player is asked, "Roll dice?" at the beginning of each turn.
- If the player answers "n" or no, the game is over.
- If the player answers "y" or yes, the points are added to their score.
- The player scores 100 points for each one that is rolled.
- The player scores 50 points for each five that is rolled.
- The dice values and player score are displayed on the screen.
- If the player does not roll any ones or fives the game is over.

## Getting Started

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.

## Project Structure
